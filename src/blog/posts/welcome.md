Welcome to Commerce On Tap! I'm excited to launch this site as a hub for sharing insights on e-commerce, Shopify, and the operational systems that help growing brands scale.

## What This Blog Is About

I'll be writing about the practical side of running an e-commerce business:

- **Shopify tips and best practices** - from store setup to optimization
- **B2B and wholesale operations** - strategies for managing retail partners
- **Systems and integrations** - connecting your tools to work seamlessly
- **Data and reporting** - making better decisions with clear insights
- **Small business operations** - the real challenges of scaling a brand

## My Background

I've been working with Shopify since 2015, watching it evolve from a simple store builder to a comprehensive commerce platform. Over the years, I've helped brands launch new stores, optimize existing operations, and build complex integrations with ERPs, warehouses, and retail partners.

Based in the Bay Area, I work with businesses across the country (and sometimes beyond) to solve e-commerce challenges.

## What to Expect

I'm not here to sell you magic solutions or overpromise results. Instead, I'll share:

- Real problems I've encountered and how I solved them
- Honest takes on tools, platforms, and strategies
- Practical advice you can actually implement
- Behind-the-scenes looks at e-commerce operations

The content here will be designed to be useful whether you're running the business yourself or managing a team. I'll also repurpose these posts on LinkedIn and other platforms, so follow along wherever works best for you.

## Let's Connect

If you have questions, want to discuss a specific topic, or need help with your e-commerce operations, [get in touch](/contact). I'm always happy to chat about what you're building.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here.
